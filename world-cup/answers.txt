Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?: the smaller number of simulation is rather incorrect.

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?: 10000 simulation will be good enough, time spend is less than 0.1s
